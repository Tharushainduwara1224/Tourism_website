<h3>Current Situation Of Sri Lanka</h3>
</div>
<h1>Past & Present Situation</h1>
<h2>Past Situation</h2><br>
 <p style="font-size:20px; text-align: justify; padding: 15px 15px;">Tourism has traditionally been the third largest foreign exchange earner in the country.  
 Sri Lanka recorded over 1.9 million tourist arrivals in 2019, a 21 percent drop from the previous year owing to the aftermath of the April 2019 Easter Terror Attacks.
  It is estimated that the sector earned around $3.5 billion in 2019.  Approximately 570,000 tourists arrived in 2020.  The effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic crippled 
  the sector in 2020, which is currently catering almost exclusively to local tourists and international arrivals under strict “travel bubble” restrictions.  Sri Lanka offers 
  a mix of attractions including beaches, wildlife parks, rainforests, tea plantations, ancient ruins, Buddhist cultural sites, and festivals.  Sri Lanka ranked 77th out of 141 
  countries in the Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Report 2019 of the World Economic Forum.  India and the Peoples' Republic of China (PRC) contributed the largest number of tourist 
  arrivals, followed by the UK, Germany, and France. 

 Investment in the tourism sector was limited in 2020, with projects approved that year valued at around $66 million. The government wishes to attract global names to Sri Lanka. 
  Several international and regional hotel chains are building or operating hotels in Sri Lanka, including Hilton, Marriott, Shangri-La, Six Senses, and Movenpick.  Shangri-La and
   Movenpick commenced operations in 2017, while Hilton took over management of DoubleTree by Hilton Weerawila Rajawarna Resort in 2020.  Others such as Sheraton and ITC Hotels are 
   in the process of completing projects.  A few local conglomerates control most of the luxury resort hotels in Sri Lanka.  In addition, the boutique hotel concept is rapidly catching
    on.  During Sri Lanka's lengthy civil war (which ended in 2009), international hotel companies were absent from the country.  Hilton had been the only global player in Sri Lanka,
     managing a luxury hotel (which is government owned) and an apartment complex in Colombo for many years.   
 
 Tourism offers both investment and trade opportunities.  The government currently offers beach land and islets for tourism development.  Eastern Sri Lanka is an area that offers 
 significant potential due to the quality of beaches in this area.  Locations such as Pasekudah and Arugam Bay are premier destinations, especially for surfing enthusiasts.  The 
 country has several parks and forests that are home to a multitude of wildlife and unique flora species and is considered a biodiversity hotspot by several international environmental
  groups.  A prohibition on sales of land to foreigners may complicate development of new properties.  Eco-friendly resorts are also gaining popularity with many developers opting 
  to establish “green” hotels to attract a growing ecotourism market segment.  Increased tourism drove significant growth in the restaurant industry until the global pandemic.
 
 After closing airports to commercial traffic in March 2020, Sri Lanka opened up again to foreign tourist arrivals under a “bio bubble” concept in January 2021.  “Bio bubble” 
 waives the quarantine requirements for leisure travelers, allowing them to leave the confines of their hotel rooms, so long as they stay at approved hotels and refrain from 
 interacting with locals.   Fully vaccinated tourists are allowed to bypass the “bio bubble” and travel freely within the country after a negative PCR test performed on-arrival, 
 but implementation of the program remained challenged as of September 2021.</p><br>

 <h2>Present Situation</h2><br>
 <p style="font-size:20px; text-align: justify;  padding: 15px 15px;">The 2022 Sri Lankan protests are ongoing[citation needed] mass protests which began in March 2022 against the government of Sri Lanka. The government 
  has been criticized for mismanaging the Sri Lankan economy, which led to a subsequent economic crisis involving severe inflation, daily blackouts, and a shortage of fuel, domestic
   gas, and other essential goods. The main demand of the protesters has been the resignation of Gotabaya Rajapaksa and key officials from the Rajapaksa family.Despite the involvement
    of several opposition parties, most protesters have considered themselves to be apolitical, and some have expressed discontent with the parliamentary opposition. During the 
    protests, protesters have chanted slogans such as "go home Gota" and "go home Rajapaksas".The protests have been mainly caused by the general public,with youths playing 
    a major part by carrying out protests at Galle Face Green.

  The government has reacted to these protests with authoritarian actions, such as declaring a state of emergency, allowing the military to arrest civilians, imposing curfews,
   and restricting access to social media. The government has violated the law and the Sri Lankan constitution by attempting to suppress the protests.The Sri Lankan 
   diaspora has also begun demonstrations against the suppression of basic human rights in the country.In April, the government's ban on social media was perceived to have 
   backfired, with hashtags including #GoHomeGota and #GoGotaGo trending on Twitter in countries such as the United States, Singapore, and Germany. The government's ban was lifted 
   later that day. The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka has condemned the measure and summoned officials responsible for the blocking and abuse of protesters.
  
  On 3 April, all 26 members of the Second Gotabaya Rajapaksa cabinet resigned with the exception of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa; critics said that the resignation was not valid
   as they did not follow constitutional protocol.Several of the ministers who "resigned" were reinstated in different ministries the next day.Chief government whip
    Johnston Fernando insisted that President Gotabaya Rajapaksa would not resign under any circumstances.The protests, however, achieved the removal of officials and ministers 
    including members of the Rajapaksa family and their close associates along with appointment of more qualified and veteran officials and the creation of the Advisory Group on 
    Multilateral Engagement and Debt Sustainability.
  
  In July 2022, protesters occupied President's House in Colombo, causing Rajapaksa to flee and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to announce his own willingness to resign.
   About a week later, Parliament elected Wickremesinghe as president, on 20 July.</p><br>
