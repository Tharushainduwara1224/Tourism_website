 <p class="bokka">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.Most 
 people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover 
 without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like 
 cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious
 illness.The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, 
 the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands 
 or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily 
 through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s 
 important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).COVID-19
 affects different people in different ways. Most infected people will develop mild to moderate illness and 
 recover without hospitalization.</p>
